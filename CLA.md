- **"Submit"**: Any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Project maintainers, including pull requests, issues, emails, or other communications.

- Make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies **only** to those patent claims licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your Contribution(s) alone or by combination with the Work.

**Patent Termination**: If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

## 4. Inbound = Outbound

This grant is separate from, and in addition to, the copyright and patent licenses above and survives termination except as limited by applicable law.
