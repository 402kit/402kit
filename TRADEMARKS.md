## Overview

"402Kit" and associated logos/branding are **common law trademarks** owned by the 402Kit project maintainers. We are committed to protecting these marks to:

1. **Prevent consumer confusion** about the source and quality of 402Kit software
2. **Protect the project's reputation** and community trust
3. **Maintain control** over official products and commercial offerings
4. **Enable monetization** while keeping the core SDK open source

This policy explains permitted and prohibited uses, with enforcement procedures.

- **"402Kit Enterprise"** (reserved for official commercial edition)
- **"402Kit Facilitator"** (reserved for official payment gateway)
- **"402Kit Gateway"** (reserved for official routing service)

### Scope Reservation

---

## ‚úÖ Permitted Uses

### 1. Referential Use

You **MAY** use "402Kit" to refer to the project:

```
‚úÖ "This API uses 402Kit for payment validation"
‚úÖ "How to integrate 402Kit with FastAPI"
‚úÖ "402Kit vs. traditional payment gateways"
‚úÖ "Built with 402Kit" badge on your website
```

### 2. Community Contributions

You **MAY** use "402Kit" in community content:

- Blog posts and tutorials
- Conference talks and presentations
- YouTube videos and screencasts
- GitHub projects that integrate with 402Kit

**Requirement**: Make it clear you're describing the official project, not your own fork.

### 3. Open Source Distribution

You **MAY** redistribute 402Kit under the Apache 2.0 license:

- Unmodified source code
- Binary distributions from official sources
- Forks clearly marked as "unofficial fork of 402Kit"

**Requirement**: Include attribution and license notices.

### 4. Commercial Integration

You **MAY** use 402Kit in commercial products:

- Build commercial APIs using 402Kit
- Offer consulting/integration services
- Create paid extensions (following naming guidelines)

**Limitation**: You cannot imply official endorsement or affiliation.

### 5. Compatibility Claims

You **MAY** claim compatibility:

‚úÖ "Designed for 402Kit"
‚úÖ "Works with 402Kit core packages"
```

**Requirement**: Must be accurate and verifiable.

---

## ‚ùå Prohibited Uses

### 1. Confusing Product Names

You **MAY NOT** use "402Kit" in product/service names that create confusion:

```
‚ùå "402Kit Pro" (implies official premium version)
‚ùå "402Kit Hosting" (conflicts with reserved "402Kit Cloud")
‚ùå "402Kit Premium Support" (use "Premium support for 402Kit")
‚ùå "402Kit Gateway" (reserved for official service)
‚ùå "402Kit Enterprise Edition" (reserved)
```

**Why**: These names suggest official products and violate our monetization strategy.

### 2. False Affiliation

You **MAY NOT** imply official relationship:

- ‚ùå "Official 402Kit Consulting Partner"
- ‚ùå "Certified by 402Kit" (no certification program exists)
- ‚ùå "Endorsed by 402Kit maintainers" (without written permission)
- ‚ùå "402Kit Foundation" (no such entity exists)

### 3. Domain Name Squatting

You **MAY NOT** register domains that create confusion:

**Domains owned by the project**: 402kit.dev (and any other domains explicitly listed in this repo).

Using domains that may cause confusion with our owned domains is discouraged and may be infringing if it implies official status.

### 4. Package Name Conflicts

The npm scope **`@402kit/*`** is reserved for official packages. Third-party packages should not use this scope; use names like `@company/402kit-<ext>`.

### 5. Trademark Registration

You **MAY NOT**:

- Register "402Kit" as a trademark in any jurisdiction
- Register confusingly similar marks (e.g., "402Toolkit", "Four-Oh-Two-Kit")
- File for domain names, social media handles, or app store names that conflict

### 6. Disparagement

You **MAY NOT** use "402Kit" in connection with:

- Illegal activities
- Harmful or offensive content
- Violations of our Code of Conduct
- False claims or misinformation

## üè¢ Commercial Use Boundaries

### Open Source ‚Üî Commercial Boundary

**Commercial (Reserved):**

- Hosted payment facilitator ("402Kit Cloud")
- Premium adapters (Stripe, Coinbase, Lightning Network)
- Enterprise support contracts
- SLA-backed services
- Managed deployments

**Clear separation**: You can build commercial products _using_ 402Kit, but you cannot use our marks to offer competing hosted/managed services under the 402Kit brand.

### Offering Services
